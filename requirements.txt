Requirements

Creating a web-app that provides users with an intuitive interface to select and process local files, while supporting multiple data types and visualization options, requires careful design and development. Given that the data you're working with is related to population demographics (e.g., "Wohnbevölkerung nach Monat, Altersklasse, Geschlecht, Staatsangehörigkeit und Quartiergruppe, Stadt St.Gallen, seit 2008"), let's outline the key functionality and approaches for processing and visualizing the data.

1. User Interface (UI) Design
File Upload Section:

Allow users to upload various file types (e.g., CSV, Excel, JSON).
A file selector that supports drag-and-drop functionality.
Display file metadata like file name, type, size, and a preview of the first few rows for tabular data.
Processing Options Dropdown:

Once the file is uploaded, users can choose from a list of processing options.
The options may vary based on the file type or content.
Example Processing Options:
Data Aggregation (e.g., sum, average by year, or per gender/age group).
Filter by Criteria (e.g., date range, specific age groups, gender, nationality).
Visualization Types (e.g., bar chart, line graph, pie chart, heat map).
Processing Output/Preview Section:

Display the output of the processing, such as tables, key metrics, or visualizations.
Provide options to download the processed data or the visualizations.
2. File Processing Pipeline
Based on the file type (CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.), the backend should handle the data ingestion and processing, returning meaningful insights. Here's how you can handle it:

CSV/Excel File
Data Parsing:

Read the CSV or Excel file and convert it into a DataFrame (Pandas in Python, for example).
Validate the data to ensure it contains the expected fields (e.g., Monat, Altersklasse, Geschlecht, Quartiergruppe).
Basic Operations:

Data Filtering: Allow filtering by month, year, gender, age group, nationality.
Summarization: Generate summaries such as population growth trends, age distribution, gender balance over time, or by location.
Visualization: Use libraries like Plotly or D3.js to generate interactive charts:

Line Chart: Show population trends over months/years.
Bar Chart: Compare population distributions across gender, age, nationality.
Heatmap: Visualize density by Quartiergruppe or year.
Pie Chart: Distribution by gender, nationality.
JSON File
If the file is in JSON format, assume it has a similar structure (e.g., demographic data or metadata about population).

Convert to Tabular Format: Convert hierarchical JSON data into a flat table for easier processing and visualization.
Aggregations: Compute aggregates similar to CSV/Excel.
Visualization: Generate the same visualizations (bar charts, line charts, etc.) based on user selection.
Custom Data Formats
If you're dealing with non-standard data, such as a custom data structure:

Mapping Tool: Allow users to map fields in their file to expected fields (e.g., mapping "age" in a JSON file to "Altersklasse").
Validation: Ensure the file adheres to the required format once fields are mapped.
3. Visualization Ideas for Demographic Data
Depending on the data selected, you can implement a range of visualizations:

Population Growth Trends (Line Chart): Show the change in population over months or years, grouped by gender or nationality.
User Input: Select time range and demographic group (e.g., compare population growth between men and women from 2010-2020).
Age Distribution (Histogram/Bar Chart): Display the distribution of different age groups.
User Input: Select specific years or months to view.
Gender and Nationality Breakdown (Pie/Donut Chart): Visualize how the population is divided between different genders and nationalities.
User Input: Filter by specific quartiers or time periods.
Quartier-based Population Heatmap: Show population density in different quartiers using a heatmap.
User Input: Select demographic group (e.g., children under 15, or non-Swiss citizens).
4. Optional Advanced Features
Time-lapse Visualizations: Animate population trends over the years, allowing users to see how the population has evolved dynamically.
Comparison Mode: Let users compare two datasets side-by-side (e.g., population in 2008 vs 2020).
Downloadable Reports: Provide an option to generate and download a report (PDF or Excel) based on the selected filters and visualizations.
5. Tech Stack Suggestion
For implementing this functionality, consider the following stack:

Frontend:
React.js or Vue.js for the UI.
Plotly.js, D3.js, or Chart.js for generating visualizations.
Backend:
Python (Flask or Django) or Node.js (Express) for handling file uploads and processing.
Pandas (Python) for data manipulation.
File Handling:
Use Pandas for CSV/Excel files.
json.loads() for handling JSON data.
Example Flow:
Upload a file (CSV, Excel, or JSON) containing population data.
Select Processing Options (e.g., filter by date, gender, or nationality).
Choose Visualization (e.g., bar chart, line chart).
Display Output: Show processed data in table form and as a graph.
Download Options: Users can export the results or visualizations.
